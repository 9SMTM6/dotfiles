# dotfiles

Personal dotfiles. Starting kindof late and sparse I guess.

This uses chezmoi.

Apply with `chezmoi init --apply --verbose ssh://git@gitea.smaier.me:222/smaier/dotfiles.git`.

I made an effort not to do too system specific things (other than some which may just do nothing), but this has been untested.
